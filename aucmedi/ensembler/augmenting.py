    aggregate function bla

    img aug none -> automatically created

Arguments:
    model (Neural_Network):         Instance of a AUCMEDI neural network class.
    samples (List of Strings):      List of sample/index encoded as Strings.
    path_imagedir (String):         Path to the directory containing the images.
    n_cycles (Integer):             Number of image augmentations, which should be created per sample.
    img_aug (ImageAugmentation):    Image Augmentation class instance which performs diverse data augmentation techniques.
    aggregate (String or aggregate Function):
                                    Aggregate function class instance or a string for an AUCMEDI aggregate function.
    image_format (String):          Image format to add at the end of the sample index for image loading.
    batch_size (Integer):           Number of samples inside a single batch.
    resize (Tuple of Integers):     Resizing shape consisting of a X and Y size.
    grayscale (Boolean):            Boolean, whether images are grayscale or RGB.
    subfunctions (List of Subfunctions):
                                    List of Subfunctions class instances which will be SEQUENTIALLY executed on the data set.
    standardize_mode (String):      Standardization modus in which image intensity values are scaled.
    seed (Integer):                 Seed to ensure reproducibility for random function.
    workers (Integer):              Number of workers. If n_workers > 1 = use multi-threading for image preprocessing.
