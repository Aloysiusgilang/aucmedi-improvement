""" Library of implemented Aggregate functions in AUCMEDI.

An Aggregate function can be passed to an Ensembler and merges multiple class predictions
into a single prediction.

```
Augmented predictions encoded in a NumPy Matrix with shape (N_cycles, N_classes).
Example: [[0.5, 0.4, 0.1],
          [0.4, 0.3, 0.3],
          [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]]
-> shape (3, 3)

Merged prediction encoded in a NumPy Matrix with shape (1, N_classes).
Example: [[0.4, 0.3, 0.3]]
-> shape (1, 3)
```

    # Recommended: Apply an Ensembler like Augmenting (test-time augmentation) with Majority Vote
    preds = predict_augmenting(model, samples, "dataset/images/",
                               n_cycles=15, img_aug=test_aug, aggregate="majority_vote",
                               image_format=image_format, batch_size=32,
                               resize=model.meta_input, standardize_mode=model.meta_standardize)

    # Manual: Apply an Ensembler like Augmenting (test-time augmentation) with Majority Vote
    from aucmedi.ensembler.aggregate import Majority_Vote
    my_agg = Majority_Vote()
    preds = predict_augmenting(model, samples, "dataset/images/",
                               n_cycles=15, img_aug=test_aug, aggregate=my_agg,
                               image_format=image_format, batch_size=32,
                               resize=model.meta_input, standardize_mode=model.meta_standardize)
    ```

Aggregate functions are based on the abstract base class [Aggregate_Base][aucmedi.ensembler.aggregate.agg_base.Aggregate_Base],
which allow simple integration of custom aggregate methods for Ensembler.
