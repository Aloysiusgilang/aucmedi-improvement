                                                Any Metric Function defined in Keras or any custom metric function, which follows the Keras
                                                metric guidelines, can be used.
        out_activation (String):                Activation function which should be used in the last classification layer.

        learning_rate (float):                  Learning rate in which weights of the neural network will be updated.
        batch_queue_size (integer):             The batch queue size is the number of previously prepared batches in the cache during runtime.
        Number of workers (integer):            Number of workers/threads which preprocess batches during runtime.
        verbose (integer):                      Option (0/1) how much information should be written to stdout.
