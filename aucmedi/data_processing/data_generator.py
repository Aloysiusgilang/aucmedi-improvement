""" Infinite Data Generator which automatically creates batches from a list of samples.
    The created batches are model ready. This generator can be supplied directly
    to the keras model fit() function.

    The Data Generator can be used for training, validation as well as for prediction.
    It supports real-time batch generation as well as beforehand preparation of batches,
    which are then temporarly stored on disk.

    The resulting batches are created based the following pipeline:
    - Image Loading
    - Optional application of Data Augmentation
    - Optional application of Subfunctions
    - Standardize image
    - Stacking processed images to a batch

    Build on top of Keras Iterator:

    """Initialization function of the Data Generator which acts as a configuraiton hub.

        Data augmentation is applied even for prediction if a DataAugmentation object is provided!

                                            List of Subfunctions class instances which will be SEQUENTIALLY executed on the data set.

            batch_size (Integer):           Number of samples inside a single batch.
            shuffle (Boolean):              Boolean, whether dataset should be shuffled.
            grayscale (Boolean):            Boolean, whether images are grayscale or RGB.
            prepare_images (Boolean):       Boolean, whether all images should be prepared and backup to disk before training.
            sample_weights (List of Floats):List of weights for samples.
