""" SimpleITK Loader for loading of CT/MRI scans in NIfTI (nii) or Metafile (mha) format within the AUCMEDI pipeline.

    This loader is intended to load only 3D volumes with annotated voxel spacings.

    By default, volumes are normalized to voxel spacing 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0.
    You can define a custom voxel spacing for the loader, by passing a aucmedi.utils.resampling.Resampling()
    class in the DataGenerator.


    Arguments:
        sample (String):                Sample name/index of an image.
        path_imagedir (String):         Path to the directory containing the images.
        image_format (String):          Image format to add at the end of the sample index for image loading.
        grayscale (Boolean):            Boolean, whether images are grayscale or RGB. (should always be True)
        resampling (Resampling class):  Passing of a Resampling class for normalizing voxel spacing.
        kwargs (Dictionary):            Additional parameters for the sample loader.
