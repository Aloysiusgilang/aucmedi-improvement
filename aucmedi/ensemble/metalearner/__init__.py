""" Library of implemented Metalearners in AUCMEDI.

A Metalearner can be passed to an ensemble like Stacking and merges multiple class
predictions into a single prediction.

Metalearner are similar to [aggregate()][aucmedi.ensemble.aggregate] functions,
however Metalearners are models which require fitting before usage.

```
Ensembled predictions encoded in a NumPy Matrix with shape (N_models, N_classes).
Example: [[0.5, 0.4, 0.1],
          [0.4, 0.3, 0.3],
          [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]]
-> shape (3, 3)

Merged prediction encoded in a NumPy Matrix with shape (1, N_classes).
Example: [[0.4, 0.3, 0.3]]
-> shape (1, 3)
```

Metalearners are based on the abstract base class [Metalearner_Base][aucmedi.ensemble.metalearner.ml_base],
which allow simple integration of custom Metalearners for Ensemble.
