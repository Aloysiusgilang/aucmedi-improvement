## <a name="CHMNIST"></a>Colorectal Histology MNIST

**Classes:** 8 - EMPTY, COMPLEX, MUCOSA, DEBRIS, ADIPOSE, STROMA, LYMPHO, TUMOR  
**Size:** 5.000 images  
**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist  

**Short Description:**  
Automatic recognition of different tissue types in histological images is an essential part in the digital pathology toolbox. Texture analysis is commonly used to address this problem; mainly in the context of estimating the tumour/stroma ratio on histological samples. However, although histological images typically contain more than two tissue types, only few studies have addressed the multi-class problem. For colorectal cancer, one of the most prevalent tumour types, there are in fact no published results on multiclass texture separation. The dataset serves as a much more interesting MNIST or CIFAR10 problem for biologists by focusing on histology tiles from patients with colorectal cancer. In particular, the data has 8 different classes of tissue (but Cancer/Not Cancer can also be an interesting problem).
