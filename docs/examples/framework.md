The framework/API examples for AUCMEDI are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.   
Jupyter Notebooks offer reproducibility by including the output of each coding block, but can also integrate commentary blocks with Markdown. Also, Jupyter Notebooks can be directly displayed in GitHub without any additional software.
