## Prerequisite

AUCMEDI is tested and supported on the following systems:

- 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 or later  
- Python 3.8 - 3.10  

AUCMEDI is heavily based on TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developing and shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.

In order to install AUCMEDI, verify that all requirements are complied and functional.


## AUCMEDI Installation

There are three ways to install AUCMEDI which depends on the preferred usage:

### Install from PyPI (recommended)

This will allow utilizing the framework (in your favorite Python IDE or in a Jupyter Notebook) or the AutoML module via the command line interface (CLI).

```sh
pip install aucmedi
```

### Install from DockerHub for AutoML

Work in Progress. Coming soon.

### Alternatively: Install from the GitHub source

First, clone AUCMEDI using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/aucmedi
```

Then, cd to the 'aucmedi' folder and run the install command:

```sh
cd aucmedi
