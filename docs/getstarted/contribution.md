## Issue

**The simplest form of contribution is the communication to us!**  

The issue tracker or discussion forum in our GitHub repository is a powerful tool for communication between user and developer.  
Reporting a bug, a feature request or just an experience is extremely helpful for us - thank you!

Here are some advices for issue communication:

- A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.
- Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
- Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
- Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and a live example.
- A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
- Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. All details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
- Take a moment to find out whether your feature request fits with the scope and aims of this project.

## Pull Requests

Here, we want to cite the guideline of [Marc Diethelm](https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312) (slightly modified):

1) Create a personal fork of the project on Github.  
2) Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.  
3) Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.  
4) If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.  
5) Create a new branch to work on! Branch from development.  
6) Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.  
7) Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.  
8) If the project has tests run them! (unittesting!)  
9) Write or adapt tests as needed.  
10) Add or change the documentation as needed. (docstrings!)  
11) Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.  
12) From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's development branch!  
13) Wait for reviewers to have a look on your contributions.  
14) Communicate with the reviewers and revise your contribution if necessary.  
15) Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
