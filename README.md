# AUCMEDI: a framework for Automated Classification of Medical Images

## Work in Progress!

This framework is currently under active development.  
The main reason this developed project is already publicly available is due to get things rolling and ensure the reproducibility of our challenge participations as well as publications based on AUCMEDI.

Right now, it is possible to utilize the AUCMEDI framework as an high-level API for building state-of-the-art medical image classification pipelines.  
But more things like CLI/Docker for AutoML and straightforward application are coming!  

**Stay tuned and please have a look on AUCMEDI in 1-2 months, again! :)**

## Getting started: 60 seconds to automated medical image classification

Simply install AUCMEDI with a single line of code via pip.

**Install AUCMEDI via PyPI**
```sh
pip install aucmedi
```

Now, you can build a state-of-the-art and complex medical image classification pipeline with just the 3 AUCMEDI pillars.
- Pillar #1: `input_interface()` for obtaining general dataset information
- Pillar #2: `Neural_Network()` for the deep learning model
- Pillar #3: `DataGenerator()` for a powerful interface to load any images/volumes into your model

Let's build a COVID-19 Detection AI on CT scans!

**Build a pipeline**
```python
# AUCMEDI library
from aucmedi import *

# Pillar #1: Initialize input data reader
ds = input_interface(interface="csv",
                     path_imagedir="/home/muellerdo/COVdataset/ct_scans/",
                     path_data="/home/muellerdo/COVdataset/classes.csv",
                     ohe=False, col_sample="ID", col_class="PCRpositive")
(index_list, class_ohe, nclasses, class_names, image_format) = ds

# Pillar #2: Initialize a DenseNet121 model with ImageNet weights
model = Neural_Network(n_labels=nclasses, channels=3,
                       architecture="2D.DenseNet121",
                       pretrained_weights=True)
```
Congratulations to your ready-to-use Medical Image Classification pipeline including data I/O, preprocessing and a deep learning based neural network model.

**Train a model and use it!**
```python
# Pillar #3: Initialize training Data Generator for first 1000 samples
train_gen = DataGenerator(samples=index_list[:1000],
                          path_imagedir="/home/muellerdo/COVdataset/ct_scans/",
                          labels=class_ohe[:1000],
                          image_format=image_format)
# Run model training with Transfer Learning
model.train(train_gen, epochs=20, transfer_learning=True)

# Pillar #3: Initialize testing Data Generator for 500 samples
test_gen = DataGenerator(samples=index_list[1000:1500],
                         path_imagedir="/home/muellerdo/COVdataset/ct_scans/",
                         labels=None,
                         image_format=image_format)
# Run model inference for unknown samples
preds = model.predict(test_gen)

# preds <-> NumPy array with shape (500,2)
# -> 500 predictions with softmax probabilities for our 2 classes
```
